## Project

This is a project for Codam (42 Network). <br>
The project was an introduction to concurrency and mutual exclusion in C. <br>
In the three different versions of this program I explored the differences between threads and processes and between mutex and semaphore.

I finished the project on 8/6/2020 with a grade of 100%.
